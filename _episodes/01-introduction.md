## Background

We are going to use a country-wide sequencing dataset from *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* collected from agave fermentation facilities.

- **What is *S. cerevisiae*?**
  - *S. cerevisiae* are unicellular fungus also known as budding yeasts. It is commonly found in fermentations of dairy, spirits, and other food.

- **Why is *S. cerevisiae* important?**
  - *S. cerevisiae* are one of the most well-studied model organisms in science. As a single-celled organism, *S. cerevisiae* typically doubling its population every two hours in the lab, which means it can be manipulated easily in experiments. In addition, most naturally occurring strains of *S. cerevisiae* are harmless. Finally, it is a great model for eukaryotic genetics and it is easily manipulated to study molecular biology, biochemistry, adaptation, and evolution. Still, its ecological roles are currently being studied.

## The data

- The data we will use is part of the Yeast Genomes MX Initiative led by [Luc√≠a Morales](https://liigh.unam.mx/profile/dra-lucia-morales/), [Alexander DeLuna](https://langebio.cinvestav.mx/Dr-Alexander-de-Luna-Fors) and [Eugenio Mancera](https://ira.cinvestav.mx/ingenieriagenetica/dr-eugenio-mancera/) at UNAM and CINVESTAV.

- The experiment was designed to explore the genomic diversity of Saccharomyces yeasts across a megadiverse context that surrounds the culturally and biotechnologically relevant traditional agave fermentations, which are carried on in regions that go from highland forests to lowland deserts. During the sampling, we collected samples from fermentations of other species being carried out in the same distilleries.

### View the metadata

We will be working on sequences from isolates sampled from fermentation tanks used to produce different spirits at the seven producing regions.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

### Challenge

Based on the metadata, can you answer the following questions?

1. How many different types of spirits exist in the data?
2. How many states are represented in this data?
3. Why do you think are there isolates from China, USA and the French Guiana?

:::::::::::::::  solution

### Solution

1. 8 different types of spirits
2. 11 different states
3. They will serve as reference
